# Q: How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
A: Part of writing good code is writing them with the thought of other programmers in mind. You want to design your objects to be able to account for external calls and inputs. This can be seen in the crud.py file that contains my CRUD object. The constructor creates itself based on values passed to it from the caller. This way, users need not hardcode their information and modify our crud.py file directly. This is what is means to be maintainable and adaptable. Readability is also considered, and it is important to include comments to unravel any complex functionality of your code. However, the crud.py object is rather straightforward and the functions are named neatly (e.g: read, update, etc.) that one can understand from a glance.

# Q: How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
A: Approaching a problem as a computer scientist means to understand logic behind the process of achieving a goal. For example, if our problem is our client owns a store that needs an inventory program, we would need to understand the logic of how inventory could be represented in a computer context. In this example, we would think on how to implement concepts we know, such as data structures like linked lists or binary trees into our project. 

# Q: What do computer scientists do?
A: It depends, but to me a "computer scientist" in the literal sense of the term works to solve problems that impede the progression of technology.
